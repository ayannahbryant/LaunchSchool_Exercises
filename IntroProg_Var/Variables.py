#Variable and Variable Names
#Assigning and reassigning an object to a variable
answer = 41

'''
Variable names are often referred to by the broader term identifiers. In Python, identifiers refer to several things:
    Variable and constant names
    Function and method names
    Function and method parameter names
    Class and module names
'''

#Naming Conventions
#Naming conventions for most identifiers (excluding constant and class names):
''' 
    Use snake_case formatting for these names.
    Names may contain lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
    Names should begin with a letter.
    If the name has multiple words, separate the words with a single underscore (_).
    Names that begin or end with one or two underscores have special meaning under 
    the naming conventions. Don't use them until you understand how they are used.
    Names may only use letters and digits from the standard ASCII character set.  

    Idiomatic Names (Legal names)
        foo
        answer_to_ultimate_question
        eighty_seven
        index_2
        index2
'''
#Constant names (unchanging values):
'''
    Note: An unchanging value is completely up to the programmer. 
    Note: Do not create a constant in a function.

    Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE formatting for these names.
    Names may contain uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
    Names should begin with a letter.
    If the name has multiple words, separate the words with a single underscore (_).
    Names that begin or end with one or two underscores have special meaning 
    under the naming conventions. Don't use them until you understand how they are used.
    Names may only use letters and digits from the standard ASCII character set.

    Idiomatic Names (Legal names)
        FOO
        ANSWER_TO_ULTIMATE_QUESTION
        EIGHTY_SEVEN
        INDEX_2
        INDEX2
'''

#Class names:
'''
Use PascalCase formatting for these names. PascalCase is sometimes called CamelCase (with both Cs capitalized).
Names may contain uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) and digits (0-9).
Names should begin with an uppercase letter.
If the name has multiple words, capitalize each word.
